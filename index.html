    <strong>Background</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>With a strong interest in technology and computers from an early age, I have eagerly devoured the knowlege and culture surrounding computers. Growing up on farms, I also had a interest in watching things grow. I saw myself as a modern day
    adventurer and sought out the most dangerous and exciting jobs to me during my adolecence. Now, I return to my roots. </p>
  <p>I attended a technical school for Emergency Preparedness and Technical Rescue, the training of which I then leveraged in (year) to work in some of the most dargerous work enviroments in Canada. From the oil sands of Alberta to the Commercial
    Fishing
    industry of British Columbia, I have brought my knowlege and skills to ensure the safety of those around me. All well having a lot of fun(?). After becoming disenchanted with the industrial world, and experiencing the damage that humankind
    is
    wreaking upon our home planet, I left to seek a way to become more in harmony with Nature.</p>
  <p>This led me to the study of the planet's primary decomposers, the world of fungi. Not only do these wonderful organisms work with the world around them, they also service as a communication network and develop symbiotic relationships
    with other organisms around them. This fasicination led me to develop my first company, <strong>Art Versus Nature</strong>. We seek to caretake these myciallial organisms, while generating an edible, antioxidant packed food source for humans.
    These
    gourmet mushrooms have added excelent flavour and nutrition to our daily life. </p>
  <p>My second company is a work in process, a hydroponic gardening container. Scalable, customizable and easily installed direct on the customer's property. This creates a quick, reliable source of produce that would otherwise have to be imported
    from abroad. This is <strong><a href="https://www.hyperlocalgreens.ca/">Hyperlocal Greens</a></strong>.</p>
